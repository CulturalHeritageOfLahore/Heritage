                <p>The origins of Lahore go back to ancient times. Throughout all its history, the city has been governed by several empires, like the Hindu Shahis, Ghaznavids, Ghurids, and the medieval Sultanate. Between the late XVIth and the early XVIIIth centuries, Lahore attained a height of magnificence during the Mughal Empire. At the beginning of the 19th century, Lahore finally became the capital of the Sikh Empire and recovered its lost splendor.   </p>

                <h1>Culture of Lahore</h1>
                <p>
                    The culture of Lahore is a manifestation of the lifestyle, festivals, literature, music, language, politics, cuisine and socio-economic conditions of the people. North-west of Lahore contains the heart of Lahore – its original cultural property in the form of mosques, forts, gateways, residential buildings, palaces, tombs, alleyways and open squares. These when coupled with the traditional cultural activities and social relationships, enhance the character of the Walled City with its individual buildings and bazaars. Old Lahore is the dense, tottering, bazaar-city of Kipling’s stories, and some of his titles, like The Gate of a Hundred Sorrows, could serve as name plaques every few steps. Old Lahore is anarchic, energetic, crowded, feeble, exuberant, and aromatic; however, it lost much of its grandeur when most of it was burnt down during the partition of British India.
                    <br> <br>
                    According to a legend Lahore was known in ancient times as Lavapuri ("City of Lava" in Sanskrit), was founded by Prince Lava or Loh, the son of Rama, the Hindu deity. To this day, Lahore Fort has a vacant temple dedicated to Lava (also pronounced Loh, hence Loh-awar or "The Fort of Loh")

                <h1>Walled City of Lahore Conservation</h1>
                <p>Lahore, the capital of the province of Punjab, and the second most populous city in Pakistan, is also known as the "Gardens of the Mughals" or "City of Gardens" due to its Mughal heritage when it served as a vital part of the Mughal Empire (1524 to 1752).  This once fortified city has a concentration of monuments and buildings that reflect cultural diversity in architecture, and despite a dynamic and tumultuous past spanning several centuries, has retained much of its historic urban form.  Upon the completion of the Shigar Fort project in 2005, the Government of Pakistan requested that AKTC make technical contributions to the World Bank-funded area development “pilot” known as the ShahiGuzargah (Royal Trail) project, in the Walled City of Lahore.</p>

        <h2>Shahi Qila – Lahore Fort</h2>
        <i class="fa-solid fa-xmark" onclick="hideDetails2()"></i>
        <div class="artifact-detail-flex">
            <p>The Lahore Fort is one of the noblest structures of its kind in the world. Rising out of the northwest corner of the walled city, it has been a symbol of its earliest days. If it could speak, it would tell such things that would leave the listener breathless. It could tell of love, romance and adventure, of dark eyed beauties and fierce-browed warriors, of queens in flowing silks and kings in shining armour, of poets, actors, slaves and concubines, of soldiers and rebels, of revolutions and court intrigues, of coronations and assassinations, of treachery and black revenge.
                <br> <br>
                The Lahore fort, also known as SHAHI QILA, is a reflection of many centuries. The earliest reference to the fort comes in a history of Lahur (Lahore) compiled by Al-Biruni, which refers to a fort constructed in the early 11th century. He further notes that Munshi Sujan Rae Bhandari, author of the Khulasatut Tawarikh in 1695-96 A.D., records that Malik Ayaz, a favorite of Sultan Mahmud, built a masonry fort at Lahore and repopulated the city. Khan believes it is the same fort that was destroyed by the Mongols in 1241 and in 1398 by a detachment of Timur’s army after which it was rebuilt again in 1421 by Sayyid, son of Khizr Khan.</p>
            <img src="images/lhr-fort.jpg" width="200">
        </div>
        <p>Mughal emperor Akbar the great, demolished the earlier mud fort, and re-built it in burnt brick in 1566. Akbar’s successors, Jahangir, Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb added several buildings to the fort.
            <br>
            Lahore fort is located in north-western corner of the walled city of Lahore. Though irregular in scheme the fort measures about 427 meters east-west and 335 meters north-south excluding the fortification wall added later during the Sikh rule of Maharaja Ranjit Singh (1799 – 1839 A.D). It is enclosed within a strong fortification wall, built in small burnt bricks. The main gates are located in the middle of the east and the west walls. A gateway, providing access to the private apartment of the royalty, exist in the northwest corner. The fort was essentially a fortress-palace, but it also, served as an abode for royal treasury, and a stronghold in the event of war.
            <br>
            After the fall of the Mughal dynasty in the Punjab, in the 18th century, the Sikhs occupied the Fort. Maharaja Ranjit Singh added several pavilions on the upper ramparts. In 1849, the fort came under the British military occupation. Modifications to the fort were made during the British colonial period but consisted mainly of converting older buildings into hospitals, barracks, and other colonial functions.
            <br>
            Maharaja Ranjeet Singh built his rooms on the upper story of the Sheesh Mahal. Moti Masjid was turned into a temple and renamed Moti Mandir. Later the Mosque was used as a building for the state treasury. The royal kitchen was turned into food storage and horse stable. The Ath Dara (building with eight openings) was constructed outside Sheesh Mahal which was used it for kacheri (court). The gilt frescos paintings on its northern wall made by Maharaja Ranjit’s court artists reflect the style of Kangra School  (legend of Krishna )of painting all around that speak loudly of its relation with Sikh period. Haveli of Kharak Singh was added in the Jahangir’s Quadrangle. After the death of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, Kharak Singh became the king but was unable to keep up the control of a huge kingdom due to which prince Nau Nihal took control of the state himself.</p>

        <h2>Tomb Bahadur Khan</h2>
        <i class="fa-solid fa-xmark" onclick="hideDetails4()"></i>
        <div class="artifact-detail-flex">
            <p>Nawab Bahadur Khan or Khan Bahadur Zafar Jang Kokaltash was one of the important nobles of Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, died in 1678 A.D and the tomb was built about the same time. During the British period the tomb was considered eminently suitable for entertainment activities and utilized as a theatre, popularly known as Naach Ghar (dancing hall).
                <br><br>
                This is a magnificent cut brick tomb, on a raised platform following the octagonal plan. Although bereft of its facing, it’s beautiful, well detailed brick masonry lends it a character entirely of its own. The division of wall surface in a pattern of sunken panels defined in Zanjira form and niches.
            </p>
            <img src="images/bahadur-khan.jpg" width="200">
        </div>
        <p>His octagonal tomb is composed primarily of cut brick work without any use of red sandstone, in contrast to many other buildings of that period. The current appearance of the tomb is much denuded: the numerous holes in the facade and dome attest to marblework that was stripped away as late as the 19th century. Despite this, traces of the tomb's original elegance are still evidenced in the beautifully carved stucco muqarnas (stalactite squinches) that embellish the tops of the outer alcoves. The design overall is similar to Ali Mardan Khan's tomb, which is located just a few kilometers to the north.
            <br>
            Khan-e-Jahan Bahadur Zafar Jung Kokaltash was served as Mughal governor of Lahore. He was died in 1697 and buried here and his tomb was built by Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. It is located in Mohalla Ganj, Mughalpura, near Chubchcha Railway Crossing. His tomb was damaged by Ranjit Sign in his era.
            <br>
            Tomb was constructed in octagonal platform by using bricks and marble, but marble was removed by Ranjit Singh.
            <br>
            The tomb eight sides are pierced with alcoves consisting lofty openings, roofed with qalib/ghalib kari squinches. A 5 feet high and 32 feet podium encircles the tomb. In view of the popularity of funerary gardens among the Mughals, no doubt that this tomb once stood in a large garden, the limits of which are no longer possible to trace.</p>

            <p>This monument was built by Ali Mardan Khan, a noble at the court of Shahjahan in 1638. He became an indispensable member and most trustworthy colleague of the Emperor and was appointed Governor of Kashmir, Lahore and Kabul. He died in 1656-57 while on his way to Kashmir and his body taken back and buried in this magnificent tomb that he had built for his mother.

                Present Condition (Exterior & Interior)
                <br> <br>
                Since the monument is well protected because of being in the center of Railway workshop and stores areas. Present condition of the monument is good and well maintained. The sings of ravages can be attributed to the Sikh rule, during which this building of the tomb and its gateway on north, was used for military purposes.

        <p>Decorative motives/ important features
            <br> <br>
            The tomb is octagonal in shape and all sides have lofty Timurid entrances. Structure is superimposed by a massive double dome raised on a drum. Although most of the small domed kiosks (chattries) at the each corner of the roof are lost, these small kiosks were popular decorative feature during 16th and 17th century Mughal tombs. There are enough strong structural evidences those suggest that the tomb was constructed in the middle of a paradisiacal (Chahar-Bagh) garden. The extents of that garden can be gauged by the double-storey gateway in the north. Similar type of gateway would have marked the centers of the south, west and east edges of the square garden. At present entire surface decorations in the interior and exterior of the tomb are obliterated except some remains of frescoes in some alcoves. The exterior walls of the tomb must once have the tile mosaic decorations which now are totally absent. The gateway on the north of the tomb still has the enameled tile mosaic embellishment to advocate the brilliance of its workmanship.</p>
